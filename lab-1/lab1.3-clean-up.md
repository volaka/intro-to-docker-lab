# Clean Up

Completing this lab results in a bunch of running containers on your host. Let's clean these up.

1. First get a list of the containers running using `docker container ls`.

   ```bash
   docker container ls
   ```

   ```bash
   CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                     NAMES
   d6777df89fea        nginx               "nginx -g \'daemon ..."   3 minutes ago       Up 3 minutes        0.0.0.0:8080->80/tcp      nginx
   ead80a0db505        mongo               "docker-entrypoint..."   3 minutes ago       Up 3 minutes        0.0.0.0:8081->27017/tcp   mongo
   af549dccd5cf        ubuntu              "top"                    8 minutes ago       Up 8 minutes                            priceless_kepler  
   ```

2. Next, run `docker container stop [container id]` for each container in the list. You can also use the names of the containers that you specified before.

   ```bash
   docker container stop d67 ead af5
   ```

   **Note**: You only have to reference enough digits of the ID to be unique. Three digits is almost always enough.

3. Remove the stopped containers

   `docker system prune` is a really handy command to clean up your system. It will remove any stopped containers, unused volumes and networks, and dangling images.

   ```bash
   docker system prune
   ```


   ```bash
   WARNING! This will remove:
           - all stopped containers
           - all volumes not used by at least one container
           - all networks not used by at least one container
           - all dangling images
